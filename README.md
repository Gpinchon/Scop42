# What is this ?
This is a precompiled version with everything it needs to run the executable.
It was compiled for Windows 10 X86-64

***If you're a student looking for guidance, jump to Credits section ;-)***

# How to use ?
Simply drop a *.obj* file directly onto *Scop.exe*, or run *Scop.exe* through shell with the model's path as first argument as such :
```
./Scop ./some/model/path.obj
```

# Key Binding
- [⇦ ⇨ ⇧ ⇩] Orbit camera around model
- [Keypad -/+] Zoom out/in
- [LCtrl + [Keypad +/-]] Scale up/down model
- [Page Up/Down] Move camera up/down
- [Left Shift] Speed up movements/scaling
- [Space] Cycle through environments
- [LAlt + Enter] Switch fullscreen
- [S] Switch stupidity on/off
- [Q] Cycle through quality levels

# Features
- This program features real time Physically based rendering for *.obj* models.
- It features image based lighting using irradiance maps and a custom BRDF Lookup Table (replaceable).
- It's inspired by Unreal Engine 4 workflow and allows for metallic, roughness and specular (F0).
- The Specular channel on the material allows for more various materials, such as lackered plastics for instance.
- You can specify an heigth texture to enable steep parallax mapping.
- Here, Specular channels are slightly different from Blinn-Phong's specular channel, it influences the material's reflectivity and behavior regarding light as it is used as a precomputed F0 value. A plastic material with a Specular of *vec3(1, 1, 1)* will have a behavior close to metallic materials, but will have a diffuse channel, unlike metallic material. In order to have "normal" plastic, it is recommended to either leave *Ni* and *Ks* empty, use *Ni 1.5* or *Ks 0.04 0.04 0.04*
- Extra values have been added to mtl files, allowing for physically based materials :
```
Nr [float] //roughness value
Nm [float] //metallic value
Np [float] //parallax factor
map_Nr [./relative/path] //roughness map
map_Nm [./relative/path] //metallic map
map_Nh [./relative/path] //heigth map
map_No [./relative/path] //ambient occlusion map (1 == full occlusion)
```
